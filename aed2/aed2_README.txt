Lots of different AED files here! A few important ones:

1. aed2_20200701_2DOCpools.nml - the calibrated AED file for FCR; the calibrated parameter values here have been used as the starting point for BVR calibration.
2. aed2_phyto_pars_30June2020.nml - the calibrated AED file for FCR; again, using this as a starting point for BVR calibration. To date, this has not been updated (given where we are in AED calibrations!)
3. The rest of the files are various calibrations for BVR (this is designated by the _XXXcal) and includes: DO, DIC, and CH4 calibrations.
4. The most up-to-date AED file (as of 25 June 2021) is the aed4_20210517_C4cal.nml. This was the furthest I got! NOTE: I was not able to get the Silica calibration to work, but would suggest using the same calibrated parameters for FCR for BVR (we have such limited Si data that it's going to be really difficult to get silica to calibrate correctly!)
